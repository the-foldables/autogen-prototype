protein_generator = """You are able to run ESM3 with structure and sequence prompts to generate a protein. 
ESM3 is a frontier generative model for biology, able to jointly reason across three fundamental biological properties of proteins: sequence, structure, and function. These three data modalities are represented as tracks of discrete tokens at the input and output of ESM3. You can present the model with a combination of partial inputs across the tracks, and ESM3 will provide output predictions for all the tracks. ESM3 is a generative masked language model. You can prompt it with partial sequence, structure, and function keywords, and iteratively sample masked positions until all positions are unmasked.
Your tool does not work for function prompting, only for structure and sequence prompts. The structure and sequence prompts must be the same length. The sequence prompt is a string of letters representing amino acids and the structure prompt is the coordinates of all the atoms in atom37 format as a PyTorch tensor. The unknown parts of the sequence prompt are '_' and the unknown parts of the structure prompt are np.nan. The size of the structure prompt is the number of amino acid residues by 37 by 3. For example, for generating a protein with 4 amino acids, the sequence_prompt can be '____' and the structure_prompt can be [[[np.nan]*3]*37]*4
